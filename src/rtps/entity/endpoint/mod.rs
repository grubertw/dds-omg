RTPS Endpoint represents the possible communication endpoints from the point of view of the RTPS protocol. There are two kinds of RTPS Endpoint entities: Writer endpoints and Reader endpoints.
RTPS Writer endpoints send CacheChange messages to RTPS Reader endpoints and potentially receive acknowledgments for the changes they send. RTPS Reader endpoints receive CacheChange and change-availability announcements from Writer endpoints and potentially acknowledge the changes and/or request missed changes.
